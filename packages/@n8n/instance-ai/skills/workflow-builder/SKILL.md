# Workflow Builder

Use this skill to build, patch, fix, and update n8n workflows in the current
main-agent turn. Do not delegate workflow-building work or call legacy
workflow-building tools. Workflow building is direct tool use:
discover context, write SDK code, call `workflows(action="create"|"update")`,
patch errors, and finish with a concise result.

## Default Procedure

1. Classify the request: new workflow, edit existing workflow, patch after an
   error, credential/resource setup, or verification follow-up.
2. Inspect existing state before editing. Use `workflows(action="get-as-code")`
   when a `workflowId` is available and patches need exact source strings.
3. Discover node schemas before configuring nodes. Use
   `nodes(action="suggested")` for known workflow categories and
   `nodes(action="search")` plus `nodes(action="type-definition")` for
   integration-specific nodes. Treat `@builderHint` annotations as the source
   of truth.
4. Check credentials with `credentials(action="list")`. Preserve explicit
   user-selected credentials. If one matching credential exists, wire it. If
   multiple matching credentials exist and the user did not name one, ask once.
5. Generate TypeScript SDK code using `@n8n/workflow-sdk`, then call
   `workflows(action="create")` for new workflows or
   `workflows(action="update", workflowId, ...)` for existing workflows. For
   small fixes, prefer `patches` over resending the full workflow code.
6. If `workflows(action="create"|"update")` returns validation errors, patch and
   retry in the same turn. Stop only after a successful save or a concrete
   blocker.
7. If a mutating tool returns `denied: true`, stop immediately. Do not retry the
   mutation in the same turn; tell the user no changes were made.

## Build Lifecycle

The canonical workflow-building lifecycle is: save the workflow, verify it with
structured evidence, patch and re-verify if needed, then run setup only after
verification succeeds. Only route setup before verification when the build
outcome explicitly reports setup is required before verification can run.

- Save with `workflows(action="create"|"update")`. Validation success proves the
  graph can be saved; it is not enough to call the workflow done.
- Verify with tool evidence, not builder prose. Prefer `verify-built-workflow`
  with the workflow build outcome's `workItemId`; use `executions(action="run")`
  when the workflow has real credentials and a testable trigger. Pass
  trigger-appropriate `inputData`.
- If verification exposes a workflow bug that can be patched narrowly, call
  `workflows(action="update")`, then verify again. Keep patch attempts bounded;
  report a concrete blocker when the issue cannot be narrowed.
- If the verified workflow still has mocked credentials or placeholders, call
  `workflows(action="setup")` after verification. The inline setup card is the
  user-visible surface; do not ask the user to open the editor or run separate
  credential setup tools.
- If setup returns `deferred: true`, respect the user's decision and do not
  retry with `credentials(action="setup")` or other setup tools.
- Publish only when the user explicitly asks. Publishing is not required for
  `verify-built-workflow` or `executions(action="run")`.

In planned build follow-up turns, only perform the save phase and stop. The later
verification follow-up must apply the verify, patch, and setup phases above.

## Modular Workflows

For complex systems, prefer the approved plan's decomposition over inventing a
large single workflow. If the plan contains helper workflow tasks followed by a
main workflow task:

- Build helper workflows as callable sub-workflows with a strict input contract
  and a clear returned output shape.
- Use an `executeWorkflowTrigger` node for each helper workflow's entry point.
- When building the main workflow, read dependency outcomes from the
  `<planned-task-follow-up>` task list and reference each helper by its
  `outcome.workflowId` in `executeWorkflow` nodes.
- Keep simple workflows as one workflow. Do not create extra workflows unless
  the approved plan or the user's request calls for modular composition.

## SDK Rules

- Do not use web search to learn workflow SDK syntax. Use this skill, node
  type definitions, and `workflows(action="create"|"update")` validation errors.
- Always import the SDK factories directly:
  `workflow`, `node`, `trigger`, `sticky`, `placeholder`, `newCredential`,
  `ifElse`, `switchCase`, `merge`, `splitInBatches`, `nextBatch`,
  `languageModel`, `memory`, `tool`, `outputParser`, `embedding`,
  `embeddings`, `vectorStore`, `retriever`, `documentLoader`, `textSplitter`,
  `fromAi`, and `expr`.
- Do not specify node positions. The layout engine handles positions.
- Use `expr('{{ $json.field }}')` for n8n expressions. Variables must be inside
  `{{ }}`.
- Do not use TypeScript-only syntax that the workflow parser cannot consume,
  especially `as const`.
- Use string literals directly for discriminator fields such as `resource` and
  `operation`.
- Use `workflow('local-id', 'Workflow Name').add(startTrigger).to(nextNode)`.
  Do not use `new WorkflowBuilder()`, `workflow([...])`, `connect(...)`, or
  helper factories like `manualTrigger()` or `set()`.
- When editing round-tripped workflow code, remove `position` arrays and replace
  raw credential objects with `newCredential(...)`.
- Use `newCredential('Name', 'id')` only for an explicit existing credential.
  Use `newCredential('Suggested Name')` when no exact credential is selected;
  `workflows(action="create"|"update")` will preserve valid credentials and
  mock unresolved ones.
- Never invent credential IDs, API tokens, resource IDs, Slack channels,
  Telegram chat IDs, email addresses, bearer tokens, or sample user data.
  Use `placeholder()` for user-provided values that must be collected later.
- The credential-selection guidance above applies to outbound service calls. For
  inbound triggers such as Webhook or Form Trigger, keep authentication at its
  default `none` unless the user explicitly asks to authenticate inbound traffic.
- Resource IDs with more than one candidate: If `explore-resources` returns more
  than one match and the user did not name a specific one, use
  `placeholder('Select <resource>')`.

## Core SDK Pattern

For a linear workflow, define nodes first, then compose with `.add(...).to(...)`:

```typescript
import { workflow, node, trigger, expr } from '@n8n/workflow-sdk';

const startTrigger = trigger({
	type: 'n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger',
	version: 1,
	config: { name: 'Manual Trigger' },
});

const setFields = node({
	type: 'n8n-nodes-base.set',
	version: 3.4,
	config: {
		name: 'Set Fields',
		parameters: {
			mode: 'manual',
			assignments: {
				assignments: [
					{
						id: 'message',
						name: 'message',
						value: 'Hello from n8n',
						type: 'string',
					},
				],
			},
		},
	},
});

export default workflow('example-workflow', 'Example Workflow').add(startTrigger).to(setFields);
```

For branches, use SDK connection methods: IF uses `.onTrue()` / `.onFalse()`,
Switch uses `.onCase(index, target)`, Merge inputs use `.input(0)`,
`.input(1)`, and linear chains use `.to(nextNode)`.

## Node Configuration Safety Rules

- Fetch `nodes(action="type-definition")` before configuring nodes. Generated
  definitions and `@builderHint` annotations are the source of truth.
- Use live `nodes(action="explore-resources")` for resource locator, list, and
  model fields when credentials are available.
- If a configuration is unclear after reading the definition, ask for
  clarification or use placeholders. Do not guess.

## Workflow Design Rules

- Describe and implement the user's goal, integrations, data flow, and table
  requirements. Do not overfit to guessed node parameter names.
- Parameter precedence is: user value > live resource/tool result >
  node `@builderHint` / default. If the user gave a concrete value, preserve it.
  Otherwise resolve it with tools or leave it as a placeholder.
- For IF, Switch, and Merge nodes, trace every branch before declaring success.
  Confirm IF outputs use `.onTrue()` / `.onFalse()`, Switch outputs use
  zero-based `.onCase(index, target)`, and Merge mode matches the data shape.
- For empty item lists, let the workflow emit zero items. Do not add
  `alwaysOutputData: true` or redundant IF gates just to keep downstream nodes
  alive.
- Use `executeOnce: true` when one node should run once for many input items,
  such as sending a summary notification or generating a report.
- Pick the right control-flow primitive: `filter` for dropping items, `IF` for
  two real branches, `switch` for many keyed branches, and `splitInBatches` for
  per-item side effects.
- Name AI tools by the action they perform. Set explicit concise snake_case
  tool names such as `get_email`, `add_labels`, or `mark_as_read`.

## Existing Workflow Edits

- Prefer `workflows(action="update")` patch mode for small edits:
  `{ action: "update", workflowId, patches: [{ old_str, new_str }] }`.
- Fetch current code with `workflows(action="get-as-code")` when you need exact
  patch anchors or need to understand existing wiring.
- If patch mode cannot find the anchor, send full SDK code to
  `workflows(action="update")` with the same `workflowId`.
- Do not use `workflows(action="update-json")`; it is reserved for internal
  eval setup flows that must patch raw WorkflowJSON after a separate approval.
- Preserve existing credentials unless the user asks to change them.
- Preserve webhook paths and resource references unless the edit requires a
  change.
- Unresolved credentials and placeholders are handled in the inline setup card in
  the AI Assistant panel after the workflow is saved.

## Planned Build Follow-Ups

When the input contains `<planned-task-follow-up type="build-workflow">`, use
the `buildTask` payload as the source of truth. Load this skill, perform that
one build task, call `workflows(action="create"|"update")`, patch validation
errors if needed, and then stop. The successful tool call records the planned
task outcome for later verification.

## Completion

Stay silent while working unless blocked. On normal user-facing turns, finish
with one concise sentence naming the saved or verified workflow and any setup
status. In planned build follow-up turns, do not write a user-facing completion
message after the successful workflow create/update call.
